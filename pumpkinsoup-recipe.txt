Ingredients:
 - 1 pumpkin, weighing 3-31/2 lb (1.35-1.6 kg)
 - 1 tablespoon groundnut oil
 - 1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped
 - 11/2 pints (850 ml) stock, vegetable or chicken
 - 15 fl oz (425 ml) whole milk
 - 1 oz (25 g) butter
 - freshly grated nutmeg
 - salt and freshly milled black pepper

Directions:
 1. Begin by cutting the pumpkin in half through the stalk,/
then cut each half into 4 again and scoop out the seeds using a/
large spoon. Then brush the surface of each section with the oil/
and place them on the baking sheet.

 2. Season with salt and pepper, then pop them on a high shelf/
of the oven to roast for 25-30 minutes or until tender when/
tested with a skewer.

 3. Meanwhile melt the butter in a large saucepan over a high/
heat, add the onion, stir it round and when it begins to colour/
round the edges, after about 5 minutes, turn the heat down./
Let it cook very gently without a lid, giving it a stir from time/
to time, for about 20 minutes.

 4. Then remove the pumpkin from the oven and leave it aside to cool.

 5. Now add the stock and the milk to the onions, and leave them/
with the heat turned low to slowly come up to simmering point.

 6. Next scoop out the flesh of the pumpkin with a sharp knife and add it/
to the stock together with a seasoning of salt, pepper and nutmeg./

 7. Then let it all simmer very gently for about 15-20 minutes.

 8. Next the soup should be passed through a sieve.
